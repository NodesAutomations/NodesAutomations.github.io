# Overview
- This is Github repo to build static website for Nodes Automation
- Website is generated using Jekyll and hosted using gitpages

### What i am planning in new version
- Build Static website using HTML static code generator
- Host it on git pages so you don't need any hosting charges
- Use custom domain with git pages so branding stay intact
- Entire website should be version controled so it's easy to maintain on my end.
- Since i am not getting any heavy traffic this should workout perfectly
- Only thing i need to pay in this is custom domain, which i am already doing
