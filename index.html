### What we do?
We Create Custom Software tools to simplify work of civil engineers and Structural Engineers.
for example
- Automatic CAD Drawing Generation or Data Extraction
- Automatic FEM model generation, Results Extraction
- Excel Automations to Speedup or any calculative work.

We believe in the Cost efficiency of technology. We improve productivity by automating repetitive
works in structural engineering. We analyse the workflow of the client and develop a custom solution to maximize
productivity simultaneously improving the quality and consistency of work.

We can capture knowledge acquired by your experienced engineers and convert that knowledge into digital form. This
solution will bring significant improvement in work quality of your bottom line. for experienced engineers, this
solution will enable them to apply their knowledge to a more critical task. In the longer run, we can improve that
solution by doing continuous improvement based on feedback collected from your engineers to make it more generalized,
efficient, easy to use and error-proof.
