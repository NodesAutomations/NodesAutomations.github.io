# 👋🏽 Hi! 
My name is Vivek Patel.

I am Structural Engineer with Passion for Automation and Programming. 

I did my B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and M.Tech (Structural Engineering) from [Nirma University](https://nirmauni.ac.in/).
After completing my engineering, i did work at [Infinite Civil Solutions](https://inficivil.com/) as Junior Engineer for 2.5 years.


I am an avid reader, specially fantasy or sci-fi books. In my free time, i prefer to go out with my friends or family specially to eat 😋.
