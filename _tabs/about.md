# üëãüèΩ Hi! 
My name is Vivek Patel.

I am a Structural Engineer with a Passion for Automation and Programming. I use programming languages like `VBA`, `C#`, or `python` to build custom software tools for my clients. If you're still confused about what I really do then feel free to visit my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/NodesAutomations) Channel to watch few project demos.


I did my B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and M.Tech (Structural Engineering) from [Nirma University](https://nirmauni.ac.in/).
After completing my engineering, I did work at [Infinite Civil Solutions](https://inficivil.com/) as Junior Engineer for 2.5 years. As a junior engineer I used to design Box Culverts, VUP, PUP, Super Structures based on RCC Girder. I also completed in-house automation for Box culvert and grillage model generation using excel `VBA`. After the first 2 years, I found the work of structural engineer bit repetitive and labor intensive so decided to fully focus on automation in civil engineering.

At end of 2018, I have decided to start Nodes Automations to help other companies working in civil engineering to automate their repetitive tasks.

In my free time, I prefer to go out with my friends or family specially to eat üòã. I am an avid reader, especially fantasy or sci-fi books. 

I am always excited to connect with fellow professionals, tech enthusiasts, or anyone interested in structural engineering and automation. Feel free to reach out to me via mail or LinkedIn. Here is my  [contact](/contact/) Details.

Thanks for visiting!
