What's good for Automation?
Repetitive tasks that require rule-based decision making are ideal candidates for automation. for example STAAD model generation for predictable geometry.

 What is the core area you develop software in?
our core area of development is  Bridge engineering, but we are willing to develop for other areas of civil engineering if we came across an interesting project.

In which language you develop software?
We develop our software in VB.net or VBA.
  
Do you develop customized software?
All of our software is customized specifically tailored to client current Design.
 
Do you develop software for only civil engineering?
Currently Yes, but we would like to expand to other Engineering fields.
 
I have an idea for automation are you willing to collaborate?
Yeah, sure. We are willing to collaborate with you as long as your idea related to civil engineering.
 
I have an idea but, I don't have time for development?
If your idea is interesting and can be used by multiple companies, we will develop it for you for free but we will keep all code related to that project. You will be able to use that as long as you like but you won't have access to source code.
