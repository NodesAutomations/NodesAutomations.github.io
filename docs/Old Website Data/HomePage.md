### How we work
ASSESMENT: Analyze and study client workflow and figure out the portion of work that needs improvement. By doing workflow analysis we can figure out where we can have maximum impact to accelerate tasks or quality improvements by reducing errors.
REQUIREMENT: Determine the level of Automation required by the Client. This will give us a pretty good idea about which type of solution expected by the client.
PROOF: We will provide a small demo for the validation of our idea with estimated Project Cost, performance improvements, financial benefits and time required to complete the project.
IMPLEMENTATION: After client validation, we will complete the project before the estimated time send the preview version for testing and validation.
DELIVERY: After the client satisfied with the solution we will continue with on-site testing and on-site user training as per requirement.
