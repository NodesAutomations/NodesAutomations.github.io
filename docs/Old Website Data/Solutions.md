WE LOVE EXCEL
We know engineers love excel, so most of our solutions are based on excel. We are using excel for input-output and .Net for calculations for most of our solutions.
Advantages of using this approach
No need to learn entire new software every one knows how to use excel sheets, User just needs to learn command specific to that particular program to use that program efficiently.
Users can modify formula Or link data with other excel sheets very easily without any modification to the program this will make sure users are not dependent on our developers for all minor changes.
Users can use multiple versions of excel Input sheet with different formula and variables, this will come handy because different projects have different variables or formulas specific to that project. By using the excel input sheet specifically tailored for that project user can reduce input errors or errors due to the change of formula significantly.
We can take advantage of the performance benefits of doing all calculations in .Net this will give our solution better performance compared to using VBA.
Excel won't freeze during the calculation, User will be able to use excel sheet normally without any interruption while the program does all calculation in background.
Our program is stored in a single location compared to excel VBA where every sheet has its separate code. So, when we will update program all excel sheets link to that program has benefits of the new update.
