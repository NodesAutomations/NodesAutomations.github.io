### Overview


### üìò Best Books
- you may be thinking, we live in world of AI, youtube , online courses who reads books nowdays
- you're wrong about this, books are still best way to learn anything new in depth with good foundation for advance stuff
- yes with AI or youtube tutorial, you'll have somethign working within few hours be they won't teach you how to think
- Everything you see online on youtube or article is pre performed show. something they have perfected after many years of working. they have already tried out all alternative approaches and fixes all problems or bugs with that code. so they won't bumped into any problem with code or software. This also applies to my youtube channel or blog posts. 
- So don't get wrong idea about your skills after finishing youtube tutorial or any online courses. they are there to help you getting started. Nothing is going to replace real world problem solving experience.

- It's about finding best solution for your projects and for that why it's important to visit this website where group of users provide their method to do given task and explain about their thinking process why they like their approach better

### ü§ñ AI Tools
- Not going to write separte details about each tool in this category because they are still quite new and evolving rapidly. so i am going to talk about all chat based AI tools in general Chat GPT, Copilot or any other popular tool available in market

- they are great to speed up your learning by 
  -  giving you real time answers about your quaries and questions 
  -  you don't have to shy about your dumb questions, you can ask it whatever comes to your mind
