### Overview
- In this tutorial i'll show you how to use VBA to generate drawings inside autocad
- I am assuming that 
  - you've already installed [AutoCAD VBA Module](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/tsarticles/ts/3kxk0RyvfWTfSfAIrcmsLQ.html)
  - you have basic knowledge of `VBA` and how to create new method or functions

> Bydefault AutoCad don't include vba installation with main installer. You have to install `VBA` module seperately.
> Download your vba module from here : [AutoCAD VBA Module](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/tsarticles/ts/3kxk0RyvfWTfSfAIrcmsLQ.html)
