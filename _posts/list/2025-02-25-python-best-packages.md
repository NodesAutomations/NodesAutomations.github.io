### Overview
- In this post i am going to explain most of popular libraries and frameworks used by civil engineers
- All pros and cons are written from perspective of civil engineers
- Python has lot of libraries and frameworks, it's not feasible for me try all of them so i am going to focus on only those which i've used personally

### Frameworks
- it's system to build apps from scratch
- Think of it as template of working program that we can modify as per our needs
- Framework provide skeleton for your app with reusable components and ready to use elements
- Benefits 
  - Reduces development time by Reusable components and ready to use elements
  - Allow us to focus on business logic and features, rather than building everything from scratch

#### Streamlit
- What is it?
  - It's framework which allows us to create webapps using python
- Pros
  - Require very less code to build webapps
  - Lots of UI elements are available to get input from user or display outputs 
  - It allows user to host your webapps in the cloud completely free of cost
- Cons
  - Not suitable for interactive apps, means if i want to build app which will can interact with excel, autocad or FEM software then it's not possible with streamlit
  - Can be slow if you have lot of calculation in your app, 98% of app will run fine with streamlit i am only talking about rare cases when you need to process large amount of data
- What do i think about it?
  - Streamlit solve one major issue i have with python which is deployment
  - You can just build your automation, deploy it on free commnity server and share it with your clients or users. User don't need to install anything on their system to use it, just open streamlit link and use it.   

#### Jupyter Notebook
- What is it?
  - It's not pure framework or library it's combination of both. I am going to keep this in frameworks group to keep it simple
  - Jupyter Notebook allows us to build interactive notebook using python, similar to excel but all input-output and calculations are done using python
- Pros
  - It's great for calculation when you need to see how's perticular calculation is done
- Cons
  - Difficult to share it with others, user will require full python+jupyternotebook+Libraries to use it
- What do i think about it?
  - As programmer i find it bit hard write code
  - It's best suited for design calculation when you need to see how's perticular calculation is done
