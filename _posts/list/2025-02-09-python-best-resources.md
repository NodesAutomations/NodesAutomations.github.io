## Overview
- This is a list of best resources to learn python for civil engineers in 2025
- Basic Requirements
  - Freely Available
  - Regulary Updated
  - Targeted to Civil Engineers
- Most of the resources in this list are not focused on civil engineering so, I'll try to prioritize resources which are focused on civil engineering but programming is still niche in our industry so you have to be comfortable learning python from generic resources

## Books



## Courses
- Personally i think courses are best way to learn python because
  - They are designed with clear and logical learning path so you'll miss any basics.
  - You won't get distracted by other topics or entertainment or advertisements
  - People who create this courses are normally more professional and industry expert than someone making youtube videos
  - Comes with Questions and Answers sections, exercises and assignments to practice what you've learned
  - You'll get certificates at the end of the course to include in your resume
  - Courses are regularlly updated to include all latest features of python

#### [Python for Structural Engineers](https://www.structuralpython.com/)
- This is paid course by [Connor Ferster](https://www.youtube.com/@connorferster)
- This course is focused on structural engineering but it should be useful for civil engineers as well you can just ignore stuff related to structural engineering.
- I've not tried this course personally but I do love his content so suggest you to try it.

#### [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code)
- This is paid course by angela yu. I've personally enrolled this course and it's really good for learning python.
- This is generalized python course made for beginners, data science, web and game development so it's not focused on civil engineering
- Only focues on basic python concepts, ignore other topics.
- This course also cover all popular python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, numpy etc.

#### [Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agwh1XjRt242xIpHhPT2llg)
- This is free youtube playlist made by [CodeWithHarry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry)
- This playlist is good for beginners and intermediate level
- This is also generalized course so only focus on stuff related to python, you can ignore stuff realted data sciense or web development or advance python topics that you'll never use for personal projects.

## Youtube
- StructuralPython
- flocode
- 
- Coding is fun

- arjancodes
- CodeWithHarry

####  [Fanilo Andrianasolo](https://www.youtube.com/@andfanilo)
- This is only focused on python web development
- Best youtube channel to learn Streamlit development

## Blogs

#### [Nodes Automations](https://nodesautomations.com/)
- I've started this blog becauase there's lack of good resources for programming in Civil Engineering. 
- Althought this blog is not focused on python, you'll find lot of post related to python due to it's popularity.
- I've tried my best to explain each blog from point of civil engineers perspective, that's major difference from other blogs
- Even sample codes and examples are provided in such a way that civil engineers can relate to it.

## Communitites
- Once you know basics of python and start working on actual project, you're going to need feedback or suggestion form other people.
- Good community can provide you feedack or suggestion to improve your current code.
- Additionally you if you have really niche problem or question, you can ask it in community.

#### [Reddit : LearnPython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/)
- Subreddit for posting questions and asking for general advice about all topics related to learning python
- This is more suitable for beginners which are learning python 

#### [Reddit : Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/) 
- Subreddit to stay up to date with latest news, packages and tools, share experience related to python
- This is mroe suiteable for advance user who want to discuss about more complex topics related to python

#### Stackoverflow
- Stackoverflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.
- It's not very begineer friendly so don't bother with asking questions here, only use this to review previous discussions or questions related to python

## Conclusion
- Start with basics and slowly move to more complex topics.
- Don't try to learn from everything at once, pick one thing stick with it.
- Building something that you use on a daily basis is the best way to learn python.
