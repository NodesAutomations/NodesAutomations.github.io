### Overview
- So you've already decided to learn programming to automate your work, but can't decide on which programming to choose
- This post contain most of popular programming languages used by civil engineers, All pros and cons are written from perspective of civil engineer
- I am also not going to include basic info about each language, you can just google or chatgpt that part
- I'll try my best to explain pros and cons of each languages but you have to make own choice depending on your domain or usecase
- Civil engineering is too large domain with lots of niche and sub domains so what works for 99% people might not work for you

### Languages

#### VBA
- Difficulty Level : Easy
- Pros
  - No Setup Required to start coding. You can just start coding right away this is massive advantage, since setup is where most people get stuck
  - API to connect Excel with lot of popular softwares AutoCAD, STAAD, ETABS
  - Direct Integration with other office software like Word, Powerpoint
  - Macro Recorder (Excel has option to auto generate code for your task when you perform task manually), this used be big deal but now since AI tools like ChatGPT it's not that important.
  - Since Excel is used by most organizations, you don't need any special permission to use it
- Cons
  - Outdated, VBA is lacks lot of features which are available in other morder programming languages. You'll only notice this after you learn another language. This makes it bit harder to develop complex software. 
  - Slow Performance, VBA is slowest language amoung all programming languages in this list, it's not a big deal for most of task, it's only problem when you need to do some heavy calculation which might take more few minutes. This is also issue when you need to connect with other office software like AutoCAD, STAAD, ETABS.
  - Lack of Future Development, VBA is no longer actively developed, so you won't see any new features added in future
- Even after all of this limiations, I still recommend VBA to all beginners. VBA will give you best value for time spent.
- I am coding for more than 10 years now and i still use VBA on regular basis, it's perfect for smaller or medium size projects specially when it involves Excel. Lot of my personal tools which i use in my daily routine are written in VBA.
  

#### Python
- Difficulty Level : Normal
- 

#### C#

### Other Languages

#### AutoLisp
- Difficulty Level : Easy

- Cons
  - Only usable with AutoCAD or related CadApps, can't use it for anything else
  - No API availble if you it work with other Apps like Excel, STAAD, ETABS

#### Dynamo

### Conclusion

- If you're employee and don't have admin access to your computer then
