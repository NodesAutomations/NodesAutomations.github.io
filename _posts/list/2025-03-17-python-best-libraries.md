## Overview
- In this post I am going to explain popular libraries and frameworks used by civil engineers
- All pros and cons are written from perspective of civil engineers
- Python has lot of libraries and frameworks, it's not feasible for me try all of them so i am going to focus on only those which Iâ€™ve used personally
- Basic Requirements for Library/framework
  - Free to use
  - Active Development
  - Good Documentation
  - Community Support
- I'll willing to let go of this basic requirements if there's no alternative available for that package or framework
- This post is still work in progress due to my limited exposure to python, feel free to send me suggestions or corrections if you find any

## Frameworks
- it's system to build apps from scratch
- Think of it as template of working program that we can modify as per our needs
- Frameworks provide skeleton for your app with reusable components and ready to use elements
- Benefits 
  - Reduces development time by Reusable components and ready to use elements
  - Allow us to focus on business logic and features, rather than building everything from scratch

#### [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- What is it?
  - It's framework which allows us to create webapps using python
- Pros
  - Require very less code to build webapps
  - Lots of UI elements are available to get input from user or display outputs 
  - It allows user to host your webapps in the cloud completely free of cost
- Cons
  - Not suitable for interactive apps, means if i want to build app which will can interact with excel, AutoCAD or FEM software then it's not possible with streamlit
  - Can be slow if you have lot of calculation in your app, 98% of app will run fine with streamlit I am only talking about rare cases when you need to process large amount of data
- What do I think about it?
  - Streamlit solve one major issue I have with python which is deployment
  - You can just build your automation, deploy it on free community server and share it with your clients or users. Users don't need to install anything on their system to use it, just open streamlit link and use it.   

#### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/documentation)
- What is it?
  - It's not pure framework or library it's combination of both. I am going to keep this in frameworks group to keep it simple
  - Jupyter Notebook allows us to build interactive notebook using python, similar to excel but all input-output and calculations are done using python
- Pros
  - It's great for calculation when you need to see how's particular calculation is done
- Cons
  - Difficult to share it with others, user will require full python+jupyternotebook+Libraries to use it
- What do I think about it?
  - As programmer I find it bit hard write code
  - It's best suited for design calculation when you need to see how's particular calculation is done


#### [Viktor](https://docs.viktor.ai/)
- What is it?
  - It's platform to build web apps using python
- Pros
  - Exclusively focus on engineering applications
  - Have most of UI elements to take input or display output
  - Free hosting for public apps
  - Option to integrate your web app with local software like excel, AutoCAD, REVIT, STAAD, ETABS 
  - Option to build private apps with secure login 
- Cons
  - Paid subscription to use it for private apps
- What do I think about it?
  - It's best and only option when you want to build interactive web apps 
  - It's proprietary software and can change its Terms anytime so if you're okay with this then go for it
  - I've only build simple calculator app using it so still yet to try its full potential, specially integration with other software
  - Platform is still pretty new so i don't know how well it's integration with other software will work over long time but i have high hopes for it
  - Additionally this integration with other software also require python setup with all required libraries and Viktor setup for that particular software on user system which can be a bit tricky. This can also undermine whole point of using webapps for integration with other software.
  
## Data Manipulation Libraries

#### [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

  - Compatible with everything be it local app or web app(Streamlit) or Interactive notebook(Jupyter notebook)
- Cons
  - Steeper learning curve for beginners due to complex API
- What do I think about it?
  - It's an essential tool when working with tabular data, there's no alternative to it
  - it's my go to choice for data analysis and manipulation with python

<!-- #### NumPy -->
<!-- #### scipy -->
  
## Excel Libraries

#### [xlWings](https://docs.xlwings.org/)
- What is it?
  - Library to read/modify/write excel file 
- Pros
  - Simple to use API with good documentation
  - Can work with active excel file
  - Currently in active development, with good community support
- Cons
  - Require Excel installation on your system
- What do I think about it?
  - This is my favorite library to read/modify/write excel file
  - only reason to not use it if you don't have excel or want to build webapp

#### [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/)
- What is it?
- Pros
  - No dependency on Excel, so you can use it on any computer
  - Currently in active development
- Cons
  - Lack functionality compared to xlWings
- What do I think about it?
  - I prefer xlWings over openpyxl due to it's simple API and functionality
  - I only use this library with streamlit webapps since it's os independent and don't require any excel installation

## AutoCAD Libraries

#### [ezDxf](https://ezdxf.readthedocs.io/)
- What is it?
  - library to read/write/modify dxf file
- Pros
  - Simple to use API with good documentation
