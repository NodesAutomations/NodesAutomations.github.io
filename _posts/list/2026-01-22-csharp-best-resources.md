## Overview
- This is a list of best resources to learn C# for civil engineers in 2026
- Basic Requirements
  - Freely Available
  - Regularly Updated
  - Targeted to Civil Engineers
- Most of the resources in this list are not focused on civil engineering so, I'll try to prioritize resources which are focused on civil engineering, but programming is still niche in our industry, so you have to be comfortable learning C# from generic resources

## Courses
- Personally, I think courses are the best way to learn C# because
  - They are designed with a clear and logical learning path, so you won't miss any basics.
  - You won't get distracted by other topics or entertainment or advertisements
  - People who create these courses are normally more professional and industry experts than someone making YouTube videos
  - Comes with Questions and Answers sections, exercises and assignments to practice what you've learned
  - You'll get certificates at the end of the course to include in your resume
  - Courses are regularly updated to include all the latest features of C# language
- I've not tried most of these courses because I am already an advanced level programmer even before I started to learn C#. But if I had to start from scratch then I would definitely try these courses.

### [Complete C# Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-csharp-masterclass/)
- This course is available on Udemy platform and is great for beginners who want to learn C# from scratch.
- The course covers all the basics of C# in great detail with examples and exercises.
- Additionally, it also covers some topics like WPF, Unit Testing and Clean Code principles.
- This course is affordable, costing around $10 during Udemy sales.
- I've tried this course when I was learning C# and found it really good for beginners and intermediate programmers.

### [Tim Corey C# Masterclass](https://www.iamtimcorey.com/courses/csharp-mastercourse/)
- This course is great for beginners as well as experienced programmers who want to learn C# from scratch.
- The course is regularly updated to include all the latest features of C# language so it's a great resource.
- This course is a bit expensive, costing around $600 for lifetime access and comes with a 30-day money back guarantee.
- I have not tried this course since I was already at an advanced level when I found it but I have heard good things about this course from other people in the C# community.

## Books
- Books are a good choice for you if you're learning programming for the first time
- Courses and YouTube videos can be overwhelming for beginners 

### [The C# Player's Guide by RB Whitaker](https://csharpplayersguide.com/)
- This book is great for absolute beginners who want to learn C# from scratch.
- Currently it only covers up to C# 10 but the author is planning to release a new edition covering up to C# 14 by the first quarter of 2026.
- The book is written with the concept of a video game where you earn points by completing exercises and assignments. This gamification makes learning fun and engaging.
- This book covers basic and intermediate topics of C# in great detail with examples and exercises.
- I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn C# from scratch.

### [C# 12 in a Nutshell by Joseph Albahari](https://www.albahari.com/nutshell/)
- This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced programmers who want to learn C# in depth.
- It covers all the features of C# 12 in great detail with examples and exercises.
- This book is regularly updated to include all the latest features of C# language so it's a great resource to keep up with the latest developments in C#.
- I've read an older edition of this book which covered up to C# 7 and I found it really good.
- You can read this book after you've completed "The C# Player's Guide" book.

### [C# in Depth by Jon Skeet](https://csharpindepth.com/)
- This book is great for intermediate and advanced programmers who want to learn C# in depth.
- Jon Skeet is a well known expert in C# and .NET community. He is also the #1 ranked user on Stack Overflow.
- It covers advanced topics of C# in great detail with examples and exercises.
- One downside of this book is that it only covers up to C# 8 with no plans to release a new edition covering latest versions of C#.
 
## YouTube
- Books and courses are great for learning basic or intermediate stuff but YouTube is great for learning how to use C# for actual projects 
- Also, you'll learn how other people are using C# in their daily tasks
- Most of these channels already assume that you know the basics, so they focus on how to use C# on actual projects.

### [IAmTimCorey](https://www.youtube.com/@IAmTimCorey)
- Tim Corey is a well known expert in C# and .NET community.
- It's my go-to channel for learning C# and .NET related stuff.
- He regularly uploads videos on C# and .NET related topics.

### [Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas)
- Nick Chapsas is another well known expert in C# and Microsoft MVP.
- This is more suitable for intermediate and advanced programmers who want to learn C# in depth.
- His channel focuses on modern C# and .NET development with best practices.

### Few more YouTube channels with good C# content
- [Zoran Horvat](https://www.youtube.com/@zoran-horvat)
- [Dev Leader](https://www.youtube.com/@DevLeader)

## Blogs
- I haven't found any blog which is fully dedicated to C# for civil engineers.
- Even blogs which are dedicated to C# are very domain specific like AutoCAD or Revit API programming.

### [Nodes Automations](https://nodesautomations.com/)
- I've started this blog because there's a lack of good resources for programming in Civil Engineering. 
- I've tried my best to explain each blog from the point of view of civil engineers perspective, that's the major difference from other blogs.
- Even sample codes and examples are provided in such a way that civil engineers can relate to them.

## Communities
- Once you know the basics of C# and start working on an actual project, you're going to need feedback or suggestions from other people.
- Good communities can provide you with feedback or suggestions to improve your current code.
- Additionally, if you have a really niche problem or question, you can ask it in the community.

### [Reddit : LearnCSharp](https://www.reddit.com/r/learncsharp/) 
- Subreddit for posting questions and asking for general advice about all topics related to learning C#.
- This is more suitable for beginners who are learning C#.

### [Reddit : csharp](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/) 
- Subreddit to stay up to date with the latest news, packages and tools, and share experience related to C#.
- This is more suitable for advanced users who want to discuss more complex topics related to C#.

### Stack Overflow
- Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers.
- It's not very beginner friendly so don't bother asking questions here, only use this to review previous discussions or questions related to your problem.
- For learning, this is still a great resource because you'll also find multiple answers to the same question, so you can learn different ways to solve the same problem.

## Conclusion
- Start with the basics and slowly move to more complex topics.
- Don't try to learn everything at once, pick one thing and stick with it.
- Building something that you use on a daily basis is the best way to learn C#.
