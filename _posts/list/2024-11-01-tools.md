I do use lot of tools and software, so I am just going to focus on tools that I use for development or productivity.

### 🧑‍💻️ Development

#### [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
- My favorite tools for C# development
- It has all functionality you need for modern desktop app development
  - Code suggestions and live error reporting
  - Code Refactoring over multiple files
  - Git Integration
  - Unit testing
  - Tools to build installer
- I am using it for 
  - building my CAD Add-ins
  - VSTO apps for office
  - C# console apps, or libraries for internal use 
  - occasionally for `python` or `VB.NET` development

#### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- my tool of choice for `python` development or markdown note taking
- this software is insanely versatile; you can use it for any type of development 
- Number of Extensions available for this is just insane
- I am using it for 
  - python development
  - version control for `VBA` projects
  - note taking 
  - building this website
  - developing scripts using bat files, [AutoHotKey](#autohotkey) scripts, PowerShell scripts

#### [Rubberduck](https://rubberduckvba.com/)
- it's opensource tool for `VBA` development with direct integration with Excel, Word, PowerPoint VBA editor
- It has added functionality that inbuilt `VBA` editor  lacks
  - Code suggestion
  - Code refactoring
  - Code explorer
  -Feature to export entire project for version control
- I am mainly using it for `VBA` development

#### [Ribbon X](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor)
- it's opensource software that allows you to build custom ribbon using xml for Office Apps
- I am using it for developing custom ribbon for Office for C# app and `VBA` both

#### [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/)
- I think most people don't know what git is or difference is between these two especially in our domain
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
  - It is version control tool which allows you to keep track of all changes in your code
  - It helps you manage different versions of your projects, so you can easily revert to previous states if needed
  - Think of it as a software that keeps a detailed history of your project’s development
  - It's just command line tool, if you need User Interface then you have to use software that support Git like [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) or [Source Tree](#source-tree)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
  - GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control
  - It provides a collaborative environment where developers can store their code, share it with others, and work together on projects. 
  - It’s like a social network for programmers, where you can contribute to open-source projects, review code, and manage your own repositories.
- I am using git for version control all my projects and GitHub to store all my code online, so I can share it with my clients or access to older version of project if I need it

#### [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- It's software which allows you use version control on your project with nice user interface
- I've used this for Git and Github for few years but not using anymore since [Visual Studio Community](#visual-studio-community) and [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) got inbuilt support for Git and Github

#### [Wix Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/)
- It's tool which allow you to build custom installers for your software or add ins
- This is not needed if you're just using software for internal use
- I normally use it for C# projects since I have to provide good installation process for my clients so it must have tool for me

### 🤖 AI Tools

- It's working better than my expectations so far, Will update this review after 3-4 month of use

#### [Codium](https://codeium.com/) 
- It's Opensource Extension for your Code Editor like VS Code or Visual Studio Code or PyCharm
- Unlike our traditional AI tool like ChatGPT this is integrated inside IDE / Code Editor and Have full access to our code files
- Codium is focused on coding and development, while ChatGPT is focused on natural language understanding and generation
- I am only using this for past few months so yet to fully integrate into my current workflow, but it looks promising
- I am currently using it for
  - While i am still using Copilot/ChatGPT 80% time for coding, Codium is great for building first working version
