### üßë‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è Development

- [Github](https://github.com/)
  - GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control
  - It provides a collaborative environment where developers can store their code, share it with others, and work together on projects. 
  - It‚Äôs like a social network for programmers, where you can contribute to open-source projects, review code, and manage your own repositories.
